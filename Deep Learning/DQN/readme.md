This is a simple project in DeepQNetworks.
The program learns how to play a game it has never seen before.
The game is simple. The model has 1 input and 10 outputs numbered from 0 to 9
Each turn the model gets a random number from 0 to 9 and it(the model) must point out the output cell whose index corresponds
that random number.

This may seem too simple, but keep in mind the program does not know anything about the rules of the game
and it must learn them by itself.

to launch the program first run model.py and then game.py
